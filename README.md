# Optimal-Virtual-Machine-Selection-For-Migration
Optimal Approach for Optimal Selection of Virtual Machine for Migration in Cloud.
The technique used for the purpose of selecting the VM to be migrated from the target host is FUZZY TOPSIS.
Technique for Order Performance by Similarity to Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) is a practical and useful s MCDM technique for ranking and selection of a number of possible alternatives from a given set. TOPSIS was first developed by Hwang and Yoon (1981). It bases upon the concept that the chosen alternative should have the shortest distance from the positive ideal solution (PIS), i.e., the solution that maximizes the positive criteria and minimizes the negative criteria; and the farthest from the negative ideal solution (NIS), i.e., the solution that maximizes the negative criteria and minimizes the positive criteria. 
PIS and NIS for all VMs is calculated and VM with maximum relative closeness is the VM chosen to be migrated.
